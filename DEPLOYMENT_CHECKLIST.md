## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Invalid signature"
**Solution:** Verify CHATGPT_WEBHOOK_SECRET matches in Railway and ChatGPT Action

### Issue: "Search returns no results"
**Solution:** Run `Refresh cache for channel [ID]` first

### Issue: MCP not connecting
**Solution:** Verify URL ends with `/sse/`, check Railway logs for errors

### Issue: Railway deployment failed
**Solution:** Check build logs, verify all files present, ensure start.sh is executable
