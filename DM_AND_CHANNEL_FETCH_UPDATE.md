# Discord DM & Channel History Update

## Problem & Solution

### ‚ùå Original Issue
Your AI tried to use the `fetch` tool to read recent Discord messages but got nothing. The `fetch` tool only retrieves **cached messages by specific ID**, not fresh messages from channels.

### ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

1. **Added `fetch_channel_history` tool** - Fetches recent messages from ANY Discord channel
2. **Added native DM support** - Bot automatically receives and caches all DMs
3. **Enhanced `get_mentions()`** - Now includes all DMs for easy discovery

---

## New Tool: `fetch_channel_history`

**Purpose:** Fetch recent messages from any Discord channel to catch up on conversations

**Parameters:**
- `channel_id` (required): Discord channel ID (server channel or DM channel)
- `limit` (optional): Number of messages to fetch (default: 50, max: 100)

**Usage Examples:**
```
"Fetch the last 50 messages from Storm-forge channel 1427374434150383726"
"Get recent messages from this channel"
"Catch up on the last 20 messages"
"Fetch recent messages from channel 123456789"
```

**What it returns:**
- Full message history with content, author, timestamps
- Attachments and reactions
- Automatically adds messages to cache for later search

---

## Native Direct Message (DM) Support

### ‚úÖ How It Works Now

**Automatic DM Reception:**
- ‚úÖ Bot automatically receives ALL DMs sent to it
- ‚úÖ ALL DMs are automatically cached (no mention required)
- ‚úÖ DMs appear in `get_mentions()` with `type: "dm"`
- ‚úÖ DMs are searchable with `search()`
- ‚úÖ DMs are marked with `is_dm: true`

**No Special Setup Required:**
- Just DM the bot on Discord
- Bot automatically caches it
- AI can see it via `get_mentions()` or `search()`

### üìù Workflow for DMs

1. **User sends DM to bot:**
   ```
   User ‚Üí Bot: "Hey, check on the storm patterns"
   ```

2. **Bot automatically caches it** (no action needed)

3. **AI checks for messages:**
   ```
   AI: "Get my mentions"
   ```
   
   Returns:
   ```json
   {
     "mentions": [
       {
         "id": "1234567890",
         "type": "dm",
         "content": "Hey, check on the storm patterns",
         "author": "Angela",
         "channel_id": "9876543210",
         "is_dm": true,
         "timestamp": "2024-10-30T10:30:00"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **AI can reply:**
   ```
   AI: "Reply to message 1234567890 in channel 9876543210: 
        'Storm patterns active. Tether stable.'"
   ```

5. **Or fetch full DM history:**
   ```
   AI: "Fetch recent messages from channel 9876543210"
   ```

## Testing the Updates

After deploying, test with:

### Test 1: Fetch Channel History
```
"Fetch the last 10 messages from Storm-forge channel 1427374434150383726"
```
Expected: Returns 10 most recent messages from that channel

### Test 2: Send a DM to the Bot
On Discord:
1. Find the bot in your server
2. Click on it and "Message"
3. Send: "Test DM - are you receiving this?"

### Test 3: AI Checks for DMs
In ChatGPT:
```
"Get my mentions"
```
Expected: Should see your DM in the list with `type: "dm"`

### Test 4: AI Replies to DM
In ChatGPT:
```
"Reply to that DM saying 'Yes, DM received and cached!'"
```
Expected: You receive a reply in your Discord DM

### Test 5: Fetch DM History
In ChatGPT:
```
"Fetch recent messages from channel [dm_channel_id from step 3]"
```
Expected: Full DM conversation history
