## Prerequisites

- [ ] Railway account (https://railway.app)
- [ ] GitHub account (to connect repo)
- [ ] Discord bot token
- [ ] All code files from Claude

---

## Step 1: Prepare Repository

### 1.1 Create GitHub Repository

```bash
# In your local directory with all the code files
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Nate's Discord Integration"

# Create repo on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nate-discord-integration.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 1.2 Verify Files Present

Make sure these files are in your repo:
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp_server.py          # MCP server code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ action_server.py       # Action endpoint code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ start.sh              # Startup script

## Step 2: Deploy to Railway

### 2.1 Create New Project

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Connect your GitHub account if not already connected
5. Select the `nate-discord-integration` repository
6. Railway will auto-detect Python and start building

### 2.2 Wait for Initial Build

Railway will:
- ‚úÖ Detect Python project
- ‚úÖ Install dependencies from requirements.txt
- ‚úÖ Run the Procfile
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Build will fail** - this is expected (missing env vars)

---

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

### 3.1 Open Variables Tab

In your Railway project:
1. Click on the service
2. Go to **"Variables"** tab
3. Click **"Raw Editor"**

### 3.2 Add Variables

Paste this (fill in your actual values):

```bash
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_actual_bot_token_here
ANGELA_USER_ID=826573755673083915
STORMFORGE_CHANNEL_ID=1427374434150383726
TASKS_CHANNEL_ID=1425961804823003146
STORMLAB_CHANNEL_ID=1425543847340937236
MONITORED_CHANNELS=1427374434150383726,1425961804823003146,1425543847340937236
CHATGPT_WEBHOOK_SECRET=generate_this_secret_see_below
PORT=3000
MCP_PORT=8000
DEBUG=false
CACHE_REFRESH_INTERVAL=300
MAX_CACHE_SIZE=500
```

### 3.3 Generate Webhook Secret

Run this locally:
```bash
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

Copy output and use it as `CHATGPT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 3.4 Save and Redeploy

1. Click **"Update Variables"**
2. Railway will automatically redeploy
3. Watch the logs - should see:
   ```
   üöÄ Starting Nate's Discord Integration on Railway
   ‚úì MCP Server running
   ‚úì Channels cached
   ‚úì Action Server running
   ```

---

## Step 4: Get Your Public URLs

### 4.1 Generate Domain

1. In Railway project, go to **"Settings"** tab
2. Scroll to **"Networking"** section
3. Click **"Generate Domain"**
4. You'll get a URL like: `https://nate-discord-integration-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`

### 4.2 Note Your URLs

**Base URL:** `https://your-app.up.railway.app`

**MCP Server Endpoint:** `https://your-app.up.railway.app/sse/`
(Railway routes port 8000 internally, exposes on main domain)

**Action Server Endpoint:** `https://your-app.up.railway.app/`
(Runs on PORT from env vars)

### 4.3 Test Endpoints

```bash
# Test MCP health (should work if server is up)
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health

# Test Action health
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health
```

---

## Step 5: Configure ChatGPT

### 5.1 Add MCP Server

1. Open ChatGPT
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Connectors** ‚Üí **Advanced**
3. Enable **"Developer Mode"** if not enabled
4. Click **"Add Custom MCP Server"**
5. Enter:
   - **Name:** `Nate Discord Context`
   - **Server URL:** `https://your-app.up.railway.app/sse/`
   - **Allowed Tools:** `search`, `fetch`, `refresh_cache`
   - **Require Approval:** `Never` (for read operations)
6. Click **"Save"**

### 5.2 Add Action Endpoint

1. In ChatGPT, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Actions**
2. Click **"Create New Action"**
3. Paste the OpenAPI spec (from Claude's artifact)
4. Update the `servers.url` to: `https://your-app.up.railway.app`
5. Configure Authentication:
   - **Type:** `API Key`
   - **Header Name:** `X-Signature`
   - **Value:** Your `CHATGPT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (from Railway env vars)
6. Click **"Save"** and **"Enable"**

---

## Step 6: Initial Testing

### 6.1 Test MCP Read Access

In ChatGPT (to Nate):
```
Search Discord for test messages
```

Expected: Should return search results or "No results found"

### 6.2 Test Action Write Access

In ChatGPT (to Nate):
```
Send to Storm-forge channel (1427374434150383726): "Integration test from ChatGPT"
```

Expected: Message appears in Discord Storm-forge channel

### 6.3 Test Full Workflow

```
1. Search Storm-forge for "integration test"
2. Fetch the message you just sent
3. Reply to that message: "Test successful"
```

Expected: All operations work smoothly

---

## Step 7: Pre-Cache Channels

Tell Nate in ChatGPT:
```
Refresh cache for Storm-forge channel (1427374434150383726)
Refresh cache for agent-tasks channel (1425961804823003146)
Refresh cache for Stormlab channel (1425543847340937236)
```

This loads the last 100 messages from each channel into searchable cache.

## Step 8: Verification Checklist

Verify everything works:

- [ ] Railway deployment shows "Active" status
- [ ] Both server URLs respond to `/health` endpoint
- [ ] MCP server appears in ChatGPT Connectors
- [ ] Action endpoint works in ChatGPT
- [ ] Search returns results from all 3 channels
- [ ] Send message works to all 3 channels
- [ ] Reply/threading works
- [ ] Tag search works (#test)
- [ ] Angela's messages appear in searches

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Railway

**Check:**
- requirements.txt includes all dependencies
- start.sh has execute permissions (chmod +x start.sh)
- Procfile points to start.sh

**Fix:**
```bash
# Locally
chmod +x start.sh
git add start.sh
git commit -m "Fix: Make start.sh executable"
git push
```

### MCP Not Connecting in ChatGPT

**Check:**
- URL ends with `/sse/` (trailing slash required)
- Railway app is running (check logs)
- Health endpoint responds: `curl https://your-app.railway.app/health`

**Fix:**
- Verify URL in ChatGPT settings
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Redeploy if needed

### Action Returns "Unauthorized"

**Check:**
- Webhook secret in Railway matches ChatGPT Action config
- X-Signature header is configured in Action
- Discord bot token is valid

**Fix:**
- Regenerate webhook secret
- Update both Railway and ChatGPT Action with same value
- Verify Discord bot token hasn't expired

### Search Returns No Results

**Check:**
- Cache has been initialized (refresh_cache called)
- Channel IDs are correct
- Bot has access to channels

**Fix:**
Tell Nate:
```
Refresh cache for channel [ID] with limit 100
```

### Messages Not Sending

**Check:**
- Discord bot is in server
- Bot has "Send Messages" permission
- Channel IDs are correct

**Fix:**
- Verify bot permissions in Discord server settings
- Check Railway logs for Discord API errors
- Test with `/health` endpoint

---

## Monitoring

### Railway Dashboard

Monitor:
- **Deployments:** Status of current deployment
- **Logs:** Real-time server logs
- **Metrics:** CPU, Memory, Network usage
- **Variables:** Current environment configuration

### Health Checks

Set up uptime monitoring (optional):
- Use UptimeRobot or similar
- Ping: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- Frequency: Every 5 minutes
- Get alerts if server goes down

### Log Review

Check Railway logs daily for:
- ‚úÖ Successful cache refreshes
- ‚úÖ Message send confirmations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è API errors
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Rate limits
- ‚ùå Failed requests

---

## Scaling & Optimization

### If Traffic Increases

Railway auto-scales, but you can optimize:
- Increase `MAX_CACHE_SIZE` for more history
- Decrease `CACHE_REFRESH_INTERVAL` for more frequent updates
- Add Redis for persistent cache (advanced)

### Cost Optimization

Railway charges for:
- Compute time
- Egress (data transfer)

**To minimize costs:**
- Keep `CACHE_REFRESH_INTERVAL` reasonable (300s is good)
- Don't refresh cache unnecessarily
- Use fetch only when needed (search first)

Current expected cost: **~$5-10/month** for this workload

---

## Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks

- [ ] Review Railway logs for errors
- [ ] Verify all 3 channels are cached
- [ ] Test search and send functions
- [ ] Check Railway metrics (no memory leaks)

### Monthly Tasks

- [ ] Rotate webhook secret (regenerate)
- [ ] Update dependencies (pip upgrade)
- [ ] Review and archive old logs
- [ ] Verify Discord bot token still valid

### As Needed

- [ ] Add new channels to `MONITORED_CHANNELS`
- [ ] Update tag conventions
- [ ] Add new features (emotional heatmap, etc.)
- [ ] Scale up if performance degrades
