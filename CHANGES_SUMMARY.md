# Changes Summary: Discord Messaging Added to MCP

## Date
2025-10-30

## Problem
The Discord messaging functionality (`send_message` and `reply_message`) was implemented as separate REST endpoints but **not exposed as MCP tools**. This meant ChatGPT couldn't access these functions through the MCP integration.

The old architecture required:
1. MCP Server connection (for read access)
2. Separate OpenAPI Actions connection (for write access)

But ChatGPT's new Developer Mode requires **all tools to be exposed via MCP**.

## Solution
Added two new MCP tools to expose Discord messaging functionality:

### New MCP Tools Added:
1. **`discord_send_message`**
   - Send messages to Discord channels
   - Parameters: `channel_id`, `content`
   - Description: "Send a message to a Discord channel for communication and updates"

2. **`discord_reply_message`**
   - Reply to specific Discord messages (threading)
   - Parameters: `channel_id`, `message_id`, `content`
   - Description: "Reply to a specific Discord message in a thread"

## Files Modified

### 1. `unified_server.py`
- **Lines 271-312**: Added two new tool definitions to the `tools/list` response
- **Lines 416-467**: Added tool handlers in `tools/call` method
- **Line 883**: Updated startup message to reflect new tools

### 2. `NATE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
- Updated section titles to reflect unified MCP access
- Changed "Action Commands (Write Access)" to "Discord Messaging (Write Access via MCP)"
- Updated connection instructions for Developer Mode
- Removed references to separate Actions integration

### 3. `README.md`
- Updated architecture diagram to show unified MCP server
- Combined MCP and Action sections into "MCP Tools (Unified Read + Write Access)"
- Updated ChatGPT connection instructions for Developer Mode
- Updated project files list
- Marked legacy REST endpoints

## Technical Details

### How it Works
The new tools use `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe()` to execute the existing async Discord functions:
```python
future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(
    send_discord_message_async(channel_id, content),
    loop
)
result = future.result(timeout=10)
```

This allows the synchronous Flask MCP endpoint to call the async Discord.py functions safely.

### Complete Tool List (7 tools)
1. `search` - Search message history
2. `fetch` - Retrieve full messages
3. `write_file` - Save files
4. `edit_file` - Edit existing files
5. `execute_shell` - Run shell commands
6. **`discord_send_message`** - ✨ NEW
7. **`discord_reply_message`** - ✨ NEW

## What Now Shows in ChatGPT

When you refresh/reconnect the MCP integration, ChatGPT should now show:
```
Actions
Refresh
discord_send_message
Send a message to a Discord channel for communication and updates
discord_reply_message
Reply to a specific Discord message in a thread
edit_file
Update text in an existing file by finding and replacing specific content
execute_shell
Run automated command-line operations for file management and system information retrieval
fetch
Retrieve complete message content by ID
search
Search message history by keyword or hashtag
write_file
Save text content to a file for record-keeping and data storage purposes
```

## Testing Checklist

After deploying these changes:
- [ ] Reconnect MCP in ChatGPT (Settings → Developer Mode → Integrations)
- [ ] Verify 7 tools show up (including `discord_send_message` and `discord_reply_message`)
- [ ] Test: "Send to Storm-forge: test message"
- [ ] Test: "Search Storm-forge for test"
- [ ] Test: "Reply to [message_id] in Storm-forge: test reply"

## Deployment

Since this is just code changes (no new dependencies), deployment is simple:
1. Commit and push to GitHub
2. Railway will auto-deploy
3. Reconnect MCP in ChatGPT to refresh available tools

## Legacy Support

The original REST endpoints (`/send_message` and `/reply_message`) are still functional for:
- Direct API calls
- Backward compatibility
- Testing/debugging

But they're no longer needed for ChatGPT integration.

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Breaking Changes:** None (purely additive)
**Backward Compatible:** Yes
