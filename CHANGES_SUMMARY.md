# Changes Summary: Discord Messaging + Real-Time Features Added to MCP

## Date
2025-10-30

## Problems Addressed

### Problem 1: Discord Messaging Not in MCP
The Discord messaging functionality (`send_message` and `reply_message`) was implemented as separate REST endpoints but **not exposed as MCP tools**. This meant ChatGPT couldn't access these functions through the MCP integration.

### Problem 2: No Real-Time Message Monitoring
The bot only cached messages at startup. New messages that arrived after startup were **not automatically added to the cache**, meaning:
- Nate couldn't see new messages without manually refreshing
- @Mentions were not detected or tracked
- The cache became stale over time

## Solutions Implemented

### Solution 1: Discord Messaging Tools
Added two new MCP tools to expose Discord messaging functionality:

1. **`discord_send_message`**
   - Send messages to Discord channels
   - Parameters: `channel_id`, `content`
   - Description: "Send a message to a Discord channel for communication and updates"

2. **`discord_reply_message`**
   - Reply to specific Discord messages (threading)
   - Parameters: `channel_id`, `message_id`, `content`
   - Description: "Reply to a specific Discord message in a thread"

### Solution 2: Real-Time Message Monitoring
Added automatic message caching and mention detection (inspired by Letta Discord bot):

3. **`on_message` Event Handler** (Enhanced)
   - Automatically caches all new messages from monitored channels
   - Detects when bot is @mentioned in ANY channel
   - **NEW: Detects when someone replies to the bot's messages**
   - **NEW: Captures reply context (original message preview)**
   - **NEW: Detects and logs DMs separately**
   - **NEW: Filters out other bots (configurable)**
   - **NEW: Ignores command messages (starting with !)**
   - Makes new messages immediately searchable
   - Logs mentions and replies for quick retrieval
   - Enhanced logging with emoji indicators (üîî mention, ‚Ü©Ô∏è reply, üí¨ DM)

4. **`get_mentions` Tool**
   - Retrieve recent messages where bot was @mentioned
   - Parameters: `limit` (default 10)
   - Returns: message content, author, timestamp, URL
   - Description: "Get recent messages where the bot was mentioned or tagged"

5. **`MENTION_LOG` Storage** (Enhanced)
   - Dedicated in-memory log of all mentions AND replies
   - Keeps last 100 mentions/replies
   - Includes full context for each mention
   - **NEW: Tracks reply vs mention type**
   - **NEW: Includes original message context for replies**
   - **NEW: Flags DMs separately**
   - **NEW: Stores author ID for better tracking**

6. **Message Filtering**
   - Ignore other bots (controlled by `IGNORE_OTHER_BOTS` env var)
   - Ignore command messages (starting with `!`)
   - Ignore bot's own messages
   - Smart detection of reply context

7. **Enhanced Message Metadata**
   - `is_dm`: Flag for direct messages
   - `is_reply`: Flag for reply messages
   - `replied_to_bot`: True if replying to bot
   - `replied_message_preview`: Preview of original message (for replies)
   - `content_type`: For attachments (image detection, etc.)

## Files Modified

### 1. `unified_server.py`
- **Lines 271-312**: Added two new tool definitions to the `tools/list` response
- **Lines 416-467**: Added tool handlers in `tools/call` method
- **Line 883**: Updated startup message to reflect new tools

### 2. `NATE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
- Updated section titles to reflect unified MCP access
- Changed "Action Commands (Write Access)" to "Discord Messaging (Write Access via MCP)"
- Updated connection instructions for Developer Mode
- Removed references to separate Actions integration

### 3. `README.md`
- Updated architecture diagram to show unified MCP server
- Combined MCP and Action sections into "MCP Tools (Unified Read + Write Access)"
- Updated ChatGPT connection instructions for Developer Mode
- Updated project files list
- Marked legacy REST endpoints

## Technical Details

### How it Works
The new tools use `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe()` to execute the existing async Discord functions:
```python
future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(
    send_discord_message_async(channel_id, content),
    loop
)
result = future.result(timeout=10)
```

This allows the synchronous Flask MCP endpoint to call the async Discord.py functions safely.

### Complete Tool List (8 tools)
1. `search` - Search message history
2. `fetch` - Retrieve full messages
3. `write_file` - Save files
4. `edit_file` - Edit existing files
5. `execute_shell` - Run shell commands
6. **`discord_send_message`** - ‚ú® NEW - Send Discord messages
7. **`discord_reply_message`** - ‚ú® NEW - Reply to Discord messages
8. **`get_mentions`** - ‚ú® NEW - Check who @mentioned you

## What Now Shows in ChatGPT

When you refresh/reconnect the MCP integration, ChatGPT should now show **8 tools**:
```
Actions
Refresh
discord_send_message
Send a message to a Discord channel for communication and updates
discord_reply_message
Reply to a specific Discord message in a thread
edit_file
Update text in an existing file by finding and replacing specific content
execute_shell
Run automated command-line operations for file management and system information retrieval
fetch
Retrieve complete message content by ID
get_mentions
Get recent messages where the bot was mentioned or tagged
search
Search message history by keyword or hashtag
write_file
Save text content to a file for record-keeping and data storage purposes
```

## Real-Time Features

### Automatic Message Caching
- ‚úÖ All new messages in monitored channels are **automatically cached**
- ‚úÖ No manual refresh needed to see new messages
- ‚úÖ Messages are immediately searchable via `search` and `fetch` tools

### @Mention Detection
- ‚úÖ Bot automatically detects when it's @mentioned in **any channel**
- ‚úÖ Mentions are logged with full context
- ‚úÖ Server logs show: `üîî Bot mentioned by [username] in channel [id]`
- ‚úÖ Use `get_mentions` tool to retrieve recent mentions

### How It Works
The `on_message` event handler:
1. Triggers on every new Discord message
2. **Filters:** Ignores bot's own messages, other bots (optional), and commands
3. **Reply Detection:** Checks if message is a reply to the bot's previous messages
4. **Context Capture:** Fetches original message content for replies
5. **Caching:** Stores messages from monitored channels, mentions, or replies
6. **Mention Logging:** Adds mentions AND replies to `MENTION_LOG`
7. **Smart Logging:** Different emoji indicators for mentions (üîî), replies (‚Ü©Ô∏è), and DMs (üí¨)
8. **Metadata:** Enriches messages with reply context, DM flags, and attachment info

## Testing Checklist

After deploying these changes:
- [ ] Reconnect MCP in ChatGPT (Settings ‚Üí Developer Mode ‚Üí Integrations)
- [ ] Verify **8 tools** show up (including new Discord tools)
- [ ] Test: "Send to Storm-forge: test message"
- [ ] Test: "Search Storm-forge for test"
- [ ] Test: "Reply to [message_id] in Storm-forge: test reply"
- [ ] Test: Have someone @mention the bot in Discord
- [ ] Test: "Get my mentions" or "Check recent mentions"
- [ ] Verify: Send a message in monitored channel, immediately search for it
- [ ] Verify: Server logs show `üîî Bot mentioned by...` when tagged
- [ ] Test: Reply to one of the bot's messages (should show `‚Ü©Ô∏è Reply to bot...`)
- [ ] Verify: `get_mentions` includes both @mentions and replies
- [ ] Verify: Bot ignores other bots and messages starting with `!`

## Deployment

Since this is just code changes (no new dependencies), deployment is simple:
1. Commit and push to GitHub
2. Railway will auto-deploy
3. Reconnect MCP in ChatGPT to refresh available tools

## Legacy Support

The original REST endpoints (`/send_message` and `/reply_message`) are still functional for:
- Direct API calls
- Backward compatibility
- Testing/debugging

But they're no longer needed for ChatGPT integration.
