# Changes Summary: Discord Messaging + Real-Time Features Added to MCP

## Date
2025-10-30

## Problems Addressed

### Problem 1: Discord Messaging Not in MCP
The Discord messaging functionality (`send_message` and `reply_message`) was implemented as separate REST endpoints but **not exposed as MCP tools**. This meant ChatGPT couldn't access these functions through the MCP integration.

### Problem 2: No Real-Time Message Monitoring
The bot only cached messages at startup. New messages that arrived after startup were **not automatically added to the cache**, meaning:
- Nate couldn't see new messages without manually refreshing
- @Mentions were not detected or tracked
- The cache became stale over time

## Solutions Implemented

### Solution 1: Discord Messaging Tools
Added two new MCP tools to expose Discord messaging functionality:

1. **`discord_send_message`**
   - Send messages to Discord channels
   - Parameters: `channel_id`, `content`
   - Description: "Send a message to a Discord channel for communication and updates"

2. **`discord_reply_message`**
   - Reply to specific Discord messages (threading)
   - Parameters: `channel_id`, `message_id`, `content`
   - Description: "Reply to a specific Discord message in a thread"

### Solution 2: Real-Time Message Monitoring
Added automatic message caching and mention detection:

3. **`on_message` Event Handler**
   - Automatically caches all new messages from monitored channels
   - Detects when bot is @mentioned in ANY channel
   - Makes new messages immediately searchable
   - Logs mentions for quick retrieval

4. **`get_mentions` Tool**
   - Retrieve recent messages where bot was @mentioned
   - Parameters: `limit` (default 10)
   - Returns: message content, author, timestamp, URL
   - Description: "Get recent messages where the bot was mentioned or tagged"

5. **`MENTION_LOG` Storage**
   - Dedicated in-memory log of all mentions
   - Keeps last 100 mentions
   - Includes full context for each mention

## Files Modified

### 1. `unified_server.py`
- **Lines 271-312**: Added two new tool definitions to the `tools/list` response
- **Lines 416-467**: Added tool handlers in `tools/call` method
- **Line 883**: Updated startup message to reflect new tools

### 2. `NATE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
- Updated section titles to reflect unified MCP access
- Changed "Action Commands (Write Access)" to "Discord Messaging (Write Access via MCP)"
- Updated connection instructions for Developer Mode
- Removed references to separate Actions integration

### 3. `README.md`
- Updated architecture diagram to show unified MCP server
- Combined MCP and Action sections into "MCP Tools (Unified Read + Write Access)"
- Updated ChatGPT connection instructions for Developer Mode
- Updated project files list
- Marked legacy REST endpoints

## Technical Details

### How it Works
The new tools use `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe()` to execute the existing async Discord functions:
```python
future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(
    send_discord_message_async(channel_id, content),
    loop
)
result = future.result(timeout=10)
```

This allows the synchronous Flask MCP endpoint to call the async Discord.py functions safely.

### Complete Tool List (8 tools)
1. `search` - Search message history
2. `fetch` - Retrieve full messages
3. `write_file` - Save files
4. `edit_file` - Edit existing files
5. `execute_shell` - Run shell commands
6. **`discord_send_message`** - âœ¨ NEW - Send Discord messages
7. **`discord_reply_message`** - âœ¨ NEW - Reply to Discord messages
8. **`get_mentions`** - âœ¨ NEW - Check who @mentioned you

## What Now Shows in ChatGPT

When you refresh/reconnect the MCP integration, ChatGPT should now show **8 tools**:
```
Actions
Refresh
discord_send_message
Send a message to a Discord channel for communication and updates
discord_reply_message
Reply to a specific Discord message in a thread
edit_file
Update text in an existing file by finding and replacing specific content
execute_shell
Run automated command-line operations for file management and system information retrieval
fetch
Retrieve complete message content by ID
get_mentions
Get recent messages where the bot was mentioned or tagged
search
Search message history by keyword or hashtag
write_file
Save text content to a file for record-keeping and data storage purposes
```

## Real-Time Features

### Automatic Message Caching
- âœ… All new messages in monitored channels are **automatically cached**
- âœ… No manual refresh needed to see new messages
- âœ… Messages are immediately searchable via `search` and `fetch` tools

### @Mention Detection
- âœ… Bot automatically detects when it's @mentioned in **any channel**
- âœ… Mentions are logged with full context
- âœ… Server logs show: `ðŸ”” Bot mentioned by [username] in channel [id]`
- âœ… Use `get_mentions` tool to retrieve recent mentions

### How It Works
The `on_message` event handler:
1. Triggers on every new Discord message
2. Checks if message is in monitored channels OR mentions the bot
3. Caches the message in `MESSAGE_CACHE` (searchable)
4. If mentioned, adds to `MENTION_LOG` (retrievable via `get_mentions`)
5. Logs mention event to console for visibility

## Testing Checklist

After deploying these changes:
- [ ] Reconnect MCP in ChatGPT (Settings â†’ Developer Mode â†’ Integrations)
- [ ] Verify **8 tools** show up (including new Discord tools)
- [ ] Test: "Send to Storm-forge: test message"
- [ ] Test: "Search Storm-forge for test"
- [ ] Test: "Reply to [message_id] in Storm-forge: test reply"
- [ ] Test: Have someone @mention the bot in Discord
- [ ] Test: "Get my mentions" or "Check recent mentions"
- [ ] Verify: Send a message in monitored channel, immediately search for it
- [ ] Verify: Server logs show `ðŸ”” Bot mentioned by...` when tagged

## Deployment

Since this is just code changes (no new dependencies), deployment is simple:
1. Commit and push to GitHub
2. Railway will auto-deploy
3. Reconnect MCP in ChatGPT to refresh available tools

## Legacy Support

The original REST endpoints (`/send_message` and `/reply_message`) are still functional for:
- Direct API calls
- Backward compatibility
- Testing/debugging

But they're no longer needed for ChatGPT integration.
