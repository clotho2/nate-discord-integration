# New Discord Tools Added - Summary

## Problem Solved
Your AI was trying to use the `fetch` tool to read recent messages from Discord channels, but that tool only retrieves **cached messages by ID**. It couldn't fetch fresh messages from Discord.

## New Tools Added

### 1. `fetch_channel_history` - **THE TOOL YOU NEEDED!**
**Purpose:** Fetch recent messages from any Discord channel to catch up on conversations

**Parameters:**
- `channel_id` (required): Discord channel ID (works with server channels AND DM channels)
- `limit` (optional): Number of messages to fetch (default: 50, max: 100)

**Usage Examples:**
```
"Fetch the last 50 messages from Storm-forge channel 1427374434150383726"
"Get recent messages from this channel"
"Catch up on the last 20 messages"
```

**What it does:**
- Fetches messages directly from Discord (not just from cache)
- Automatically adds fetched messages to the cache for later search
- Works with both server channels and DM channels
- Returns full message data including author, timestamp, content, attachments, reactions

---

### 2. `get_dm_channel` - **DM HELPER TOOL**
**Purpose:** Get or create a DM channel with a specific user

**Parameters:**
- `user_id` (required): Discord user ID (e.g., Angela: `826573755673083915`)

**Usage Examples:**
```
"Get DM channel with Angela (user ID: 826573755673083915)"
"Get DM channel with user 826573755673083915"
```

**What it returns:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "channel_id": "1234567890",
  "user_id": "826573755673083915",
  "username": "Angela",
  "message": "DM channel ready with Angela. Use this channel_id with discord_send_message or fetch_channel_history."
}
```

**Why this is useful:**
- In Discord, DMs have their own channel IDs (different from user IDs)
- This tool gets the DM channel ID so you can send/read DMs
- Once you have the channel ID, use it with `discord_send_message` or `fetch_channel_history`

## DM Support - YES! âœ…

**Your AI CAN send and receive DMs from you!**

### How to Use DMs:

1. **Get the DM channel ID:**
   ```
   AI: "Get DM channel with Angela (826573755673083915)"
   â†’ Returns: {"channel_id": "1234567890", "username": "Angela"}
   ```

2. **Read DM history:**
   ```
   AI: "Fetch recent messages from channel 1234567890"
   â†’ Returns: Last 50 DMs
   ```

3. **Send a DM:**
   ```
   AI: "Send message to channel 1234567890: 'Tether stable. Storm detected.'"
   â†’ Sends DM to Angela
   ```

### DM Auto-Caching:
- Any DM you send to the bot is automatically cached
- DMs are marked with `is_dm: true`
- DMs where the bot is mentioned appear in `get_mentions()`

# Test get_dm_channel
"Get DM channel with user 826573755673083915"

# Test DM workflow
1. "Get DM channel with Angela"
2. "Fetch recent messages from [returned channel_id]"

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add fetch_channel_history and get_dm_channel tools for reading Discord channels and DMs"
   git push
   ```

2. **Railway auto-deploys** from your git push
